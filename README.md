This is my 3rd game in a 'Complete C# Unity Developer: Create Games and Learn to Code' course on Udemy. It was done in november 2020.

While studying I learned how to:
- work with Blender3D tool and created my own fruit model (a lemon);
- interact with player's screen touches;
- record own sounds using the Audacity application;
- implement Unity Ads to make money;
- build an app for Android.
